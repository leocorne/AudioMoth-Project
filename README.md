# AudioMoth-Project #
A modified version of the AudioMoth standard firmware. This software performs live classification of samples using a neural network and saves audio clips containing a specific sound. The neural network here is trained to detect [coqu√≠ frog](https://freesound.org/people/tombenedict/sounds/397998/) sounds.

### Usage ###

When run, this implementation will flash an LED and handle USB interactions to enable communication with the [AudioMoth Time App](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Time-App).

### Documentation ###

See the [Wiki](https://github.com/OpenAcousticDevices/AudioMoth-Project/wiki/AudioMoth) for details of how to compile this example project and how to use the AudioMoth library.
